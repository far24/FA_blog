      <description>This week’s tidytuesday dataset explores the cost of transit projects for different countries of the world. The data is downloaded from the github repository.
# read in the data manuallytransit_cost &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-05/transit_cost.csv&amp;#39;)Let’s look at the cost of transit projects in Japan (JP) and United States (US). Both of these countries are categorized as developed countries, but are located in different continent.

      <description>GoalThe goal of this blogpost is to learn how to draw a bivariate mapusing “ggplot2” and “sf” package.
I am very closely follwing the instruction from this tutorial
A little about the datasetThe example dataset contains a list for the geophaphy of the United Kingdom (UK) at UTLA level and related attribute table. You can think the UTLA as a small geographic unit (i.e., region) in the UK.</description>

      <description>R webscapewhy we would do webscraps?quickly get data from website that has multiple pagessome of the sites offering webscraping serviceshtttps://listly.iohtttps://webhose.io/htttps://scrapinghub.com/htttps://webscraping.comApproachThe approach of this tutorial is to learn by working with an example. So, different types of websites are presented that would be used to extract information. The type of website refers to the technology it uses.</description>
